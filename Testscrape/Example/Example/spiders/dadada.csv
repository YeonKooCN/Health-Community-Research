I’m so frustrated. I’ve tracked my calories(1200) for the last 3 weeks aside from a handful of meals I wasn’t able to count on. I walk/run everyday. I try to drink at least 90oz of water.<br>
<br>
I currently weigh 145 which is more than when I started tracking, I only weighed 140 then. I have calorie tracked several times in the past. Never got under 138.<br>
<br>
I’m a recovering anorexic. I was that way for 3 years. I think it damaged my body where it’s makes it impossible for me to lose weight. I’ve been eating normally for 5years. I’ve tried to get back down to 120ish for 4 years now. I did have a baby in there though.<br>
<br>
Please don’t tell me I don’t need to lose weight. I know how I used to weigh!!! I honestly need help from someone to help me figure out why I can’t lose weight or even just inches. Someone has to have gone through something like this. </div>"

First, we/you need to keep in mind your recovery. Is it the number on the scale that bothers you so much, or is it how you feel or think you look in the mirror? If it's the number, remember that it's just a number and it does not control you or define you. If you don't look the way you want to, perhaps recomp might be more helpful to you rather than focusing on the scale.<br>

<br>
<br>
Second, 1,200 is a fairly low calorie goal unless you're older, really short, or obese (or some combination of those). I am guessing you set your goal to lose 2 pounds per week because you'd love to hit your goal weight faster? A more realistic goal is probably 0.5 - 1 pound per week. I know, it's slow. But it is the healthier way to go to avoid slipping into old habits.<br>

Finally, three weeks is not much time to see progress. Be patient with yourself and be kind to yourself. <span class=""legacysmiles legacysmileflowerforyou""><span>:flowerforyou:</span></span><br>

Why are you only eating 1200 calories when active?<br>
<br>
That's still dangerously low.<br>
<br>
And ideal weight goes mostly by height, which you didn't mention. If eating too low of calories, weight's not the main concern.<br>
<br>
I'm a recovered anorexic. I'm 5'8"" and had heart failure at 25 years old weighing 134. No precursors or warnings, just started gaining weight, gained 102 lbs pretty much over night in water weight, because the heart had slowed. (Less than two months, felt like it was over night)<br>
<br>
I suggest check with a doctor about your calorie intake, activity level, and your weight gain.<br>
<br>
And do any dieting under a doctor's supervision.<br>

Hard to give much advice without more information (M/F, height, age, overall activity level, etc).<br>
<br>
I'm a 5' 7"" F and once I'm into the 140's it gets harder for me to lose. My hunger tends to escalate quickly (especially if I'm working out) but the scale verifies that I cannot eat more than I am - I do, however, eat a fair bit more than you (with exercise included, sedentary desk job, I get about 1800kcal/day).<br>
<br>
I find it much more manageable to keep my losses slower, anything over 1 pound a week I simply cannot sustain. My weight also tends to ""woosh"" - I won't see much movement on the scale for a couple/few weeks, then ""woosh"" down 1-2 pounds. Rinse and repeat.<br>
<br>
Ideal for me is around 128-132 (ish, I will reevaluate when I get into the 130's). It's not easy. I'm in a healthy weight range, but for my body, it is not healthy (I carry my weight right around my middle, lose from the outside in with the saddle bags the last thing to go). It needs to be a slow process, and it needs to be something you realize is going to be on-going, probably forever. The maintenance forum is great for understanding that we don't get to a ""goal"" and then we're done, but that we need to be doing things that we will sustain indefinitely. </div>"

Before I was anorexic, I was around 125 pounds. I am comfortable at my weight. I have tracked inches. I have recomped to an extent. My waist is 26in. But my hips won’t budge from 38. I know it’s low for most people. But I’m literally pretty full on that. I don’t calculate any veggies or fruit in other than potatoes because it’s just easier to just let those be. I weigh everything. Just frustrated that my body refuses to change even when I really really try. </div>"

No!!! 1200 is standard for a very short (under 5') female who's bedridden to lose weight. NOT standard for a 5'4"" ACTIVE female.<br>
<br>
Denial is a major part of several psychological disorders.<br>
<br>
I, too, was extremely underweight through teen years. Doctors were always telling me I needed to put on weight (along with family and friends).<br>
<br>
As a young adult, I kept my weight between 130-140 for 7 years. Got pregnant, weight went up to 145, miscarriaged, tried to lose weight from pregnancy, was down to 134 lbs size 9/10.<br>
<br>
Sounds like a healthy weight and size, right?<br>
<br>
I was never hungry, didn't feel like I was starving....Because as someone who'd suffered with an eating disorder... It damaged normal signals... Like hunger, and hormones, metabolism, adrenal issues...<br>
<br>
Now, after 20 years of continuously developing a healthy relationship with food.<br>
<br>
I eat around 1500-1650 to lose, try to NEVER dip below 1300.<br>
<br>
If I exercise, it's 30-45 minutes of light exercising, 3-4 days a week.<br>
<br>
My goal weight, at 5'8"", I try to get to, then maintain is now 165-175...I Know I look fit and healthy here and feel fit.<br>
<br>
When my heart failed, I went to the doctor after putting on just a few lbs while still exercising and dieting... Was told, I was finally just putting on weight, nothing to worry about.... Going back into doctors at 236 lbs a month and a half later, hearing the words ""morbidly obese"" and ""congestive heart failure"" was crushing!!<br>
<br>
I wish someone would have told me this was even a possibility, didn't have internet back then, anorexia was rarely diagnosed back then. It's not worth the risk to drop another inch or two or another 5-10 lbs.<br>
<br>
If your heart fails, and you gain 75-200 lbs of water weight, with stretched deformed loose skin hanging everywhere (arms, thighs, stomach, breast), you'll wish you could have a waist that measures 38"".... much less, hips.<br>

I'm 5'4 and barely lightly active. I started at 145 lbs and never ate below 1500 cals to get down to 125, but it did take a lot of time.<br>
<br>
If you had a miscarriage just 3 weeks ago, your body is still recovering, which will include water weight fluctuations. You need to give your mind and body a second to heal. Eat maintenance for at least a couple of weeks. Then set yourself to lose 0.5lbs per week and lightly active and eat all those calories. Considering your history, I would think that losing slowly is best. If you feel that you have lasting physical effects from the time you were underweight, you should discuss that with your doctor.<br>
<br>
Do check out the Recomp thread linked in Sugar's post, even if you want to continue losing weight, it gives a great perspective on strength training and body aesthetics.<br>

I’m noticing that you’ve mentioned a couple of times that you don’t track any fruits or vegetables other than potatoes. In order to get a more accurate picture of where you are it might be a plan to start tracking them for a while and see where your intake actually is. If you’re aiming at 1200 but not tracking fruit and veg it’s possible you’re eating closer to the 1500 mark anyway.<br>
<br>
How much difference this might make depends on how much fruit, which fruit, how many vegetables and what veg you’re eating, obviously. Fruit, in particular, can be more calorific than your instinct might tell you.<br>
<br>
In light of your history I’m not going to comment on the level you need to be eating at, others have already done so, anyway. I’m just wondering if getting more accurate numbers to work on you can find your way through your situation. </div>"

I'm really sorry to hear about your miscarriage. <img class=""emoji"" src=""https://community.myfitnesspal.com/en/resources/emoji/frowning.png"" title="":("" alt="":("" height=""20""> Please focus on getting help dealing with the physical and mental stuff that goes with such a traumatic event. Your perception of your body is going to be different right now, because it's been going through changes related to pregnancy. It will take time for your body to shift back to some state of ""normal"". As a recovering anorexic, your idea of normal may not be the actual norm for a person of your height/weight/age.<br>
<br>
You mention that you want hips smaller than 39"", and that once they were 34"". You also mention you've had a son. A hip measurement of 34"" may not be physically possible for you any more. It's quite common for the pelvic area to expand during pregnancy - you're growing a human being after all - and the inner frame doesn't always contract back to where it was. It doesn't mean you're fat or you gained too much weight. Your actual frame may have changed. You can't control that, so you have to learn to change your perception of yourself and set realistic expectations of what you can do.<br>

I'm deeply sorry you suffered a miscarriage recently. Its something which leaves such a large hole which is hard to fill. I came across some interesting listening from a UK programme. There was nothing you could have done differently to have prevented it. I hope you feel well enough to invite the little one again one day. Dieting too hard when you are recovering is not going to help, it will probably hinder your recuperation. I agree with those who say to return to maintenance for a while, I'm sure your family will support you. They want you well and achieving in other ways for now.<br>

I wonder if you had started gaining because of your intended second pregnancy and the weight was a natural consequence of having started a little person, I know even at three months a little one in itself weighs little but the surrounding changes do carry weight implications more for some than others. So yes, you were/are a little heavier now, possibly until your hormones, which can take a year to settled back, naturally resolves from this very, very sad situation.<br>
<br>
The one thing which sticks in my mind when I had my daughter so many years ago, was My hips were never the same again, I'd become a woman not the young girl I'd been. Its a very sad fact that, a first pregnancy changes the way our body was called on to work and hip widening can be a consequence of carrying.<br>
<br>
Please take extra special care of yourself. Wishing you All the Very Best for your future. </div>"

It's worrisome that you say 115 was severely under weight for you and yet you're trying to get to 125. That seems like it may not actually be a healthy weight for you.</div>

115 is not severly underweight for 5'4, that is healthy? I thought you said you are 5'4? </div>"

<div class=""QuoteText"">Why are you only eating 1200 calories when active?<br>
<br>
That's still dangerously low.<br>
<br>
And ideal weight goes mostly by height, which you didn't mention. If eating too low of calories, weight's not the main concern.<br>
<br>
I'm a recovered anorexic. I'm 5'8"" and had heart failure at 25 years old weighing 134. No precursors or warnings, just started gaining weight, gained 102 lbs pretty much over night in water weight, because the heart had slowed. (Less than two months, felt like it was over night)<br>
<br>
I suggest check with a doctor about your calorie intake, activity level, and your weight gain.<br>
<br>
And do any dieting under a doctor's supervision.<br>
</div>

<br>
If it’s accepted by the standards how is it too low? I’m not starving myself. I’m 5’4.<br>
<br>
I was severely underweight (115 if not under that) so I know a lot of it was to do with me starving myself for so long. I was a teenager. And I didn’t know better. I didn’t know I had an eating disorder until I was out of it.</div>

<br>
If you were 115 you were not anorexic. You have to have a BMI below 17 to be diagnosed. I wouldn't worry since you were not that underweight unless you have a treatment team that says you have reason to worry. Being 115 at 5'4 for a few years is completely healthy so the only damage would have came from undereating which anyone can have. </div>"

I thought she said she is 5'4"" in which case 115 pounds is not ""severely underweight"". It is a bmi of 19.7.</div>

""I"" didn't say she was severely underweight, she did. I figured maybe she typed her height wrong. </div>"

She could have been diagnosed with Atypical Anorexia. It is dangerous to assume that just because someone does not look sick, they are fine.<br>
DSM-V definition of Atypical anorexia nervosa: an eating disorder wherein “all of the criteria for AN are met, except that despite significant weight loss, the individual’s weight is within or above the normal range.” </div>"

<div class=""QuoteText"">I’m so frustrated. I’ve tracked my calories(1200) for the last 3 weeks aside from a handful of meals I wasn’t able to count on. I walk/run everyday. I try to drink at least 90oz of water.<br>
<br>
I currently weigh 145 which is more than when I started tracking, I only weighed 140 then. I have calorie tracked several times in the past. Never got under 138.<br>
<br>
I’m a recovering anorexic. I was that way for 3 years. I think it damaged my body where it’s makes it impossible for me to lose weight. I’ve been eating normally for 5years. I’ve tried to get back down to 120ish for 4 years now. I did have a baby in there though.<br>
<br>
Please don’t tell me I don’t need to lose weight. I know how I used to weigh!!! I honestly need help from someone to help me figure out why I can’t lose weight or even just inches. Someone has to have gone through something like this.</div>
</blockquote>
<br>
For me I started losing again when I added in 150 more calories. I too eat 1200 (because I use a wheelchair I am the very definition of ""sedentary"" and I'm short). When I added in those calories my 6 month plateau broke and I started losing again </div>"
