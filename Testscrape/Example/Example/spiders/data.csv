I’m so frustrated. I’ve tracked my calories(1200) for the last 3 weeks aside from a handful of meals I wasn’t able to count on. I walk/run everyday. I try to drink at least 90oz of water.<br>
<br>
I currently weigh 145 which is more than when I started tracking, I only weighed 140 then. I have calorie tracked several times in the past. Never got under 138.<br>
<br>
I’m a recovering anorexic. I was that way for 3 years. I think it damaged my body where it’s makes it impossible for me to lose weight. I’ve been eating normally for 5years. I’ve tried to get back down to 120ish for 4 years now. I did have a baby in there though.<br>
<br>
Please don’t tell me I don’t need to lose weight. I know how I used to weigh!!! I honestly need help from someone to help me figure out why I can’t lose weight or even just inches. Someone has to have gone through something like this. </div>"

A couple of thoughts. <img class=""emoji"" src=""https://community.myfitnesspal.com/en/resources/emoji/smile.png"" title="":)"" alt="":)"" height=""20""><br>
<br>
First, we/you need to keep in mind your recovery. Is it the number on the scale that bothers you so much, or is it how you feel or think you look in the mirror? If it's the number, remember that it's just a number and it does not control you or define you. If you don't look the way you want to, perhaps recomp might be more helpful to you rather than focusing on the scale.<br>

There's a big recomp thread here, full of great suggestions, progress photos, etc.:<br>

<br>
<br>
Second, 1,200 is a fairly low calorie goal unless you're older, really short, or obese (or some combination of those). I am guessing you set your goal to lose 2 pounds per week because you'd love to hit your goal weight faster? A more realistic goal is probably 0.5 - 1 pound per week. I know, it's slow. But it is the healthier way to go to avoid slipping into old habits.<br>
<br>
Finally, three weeks is not much time to see progress. Be patient with yourself and be kind to yourself. <span class=""legacysmiles legacysmileflowerforyou""><span>:flowerforyou:</span></span><br>

Tempted to ask how tall you are? I wonder if you've had yourself checked out to ensure there is nothing going on, pregnancy can disrupt things for some though you have not said you are gaining necessarily, could be covered by cycles and things clouding the picture by increasing the appearance of your weight. Try not to stress about things, it is essential you take care of yourself to keep from slipping back in to your old ways. I agree with the above poster, if you can set your activity level to, loose 1 lb a week, possibly half, and also put yourself into at least lightly active, with a little one wising about you have to be more than sedentary, as ggc is at my feet, giggle. Doing so will give you sufficient help you feel better in yourself and reduce the risk of over doing foods. I agree weigh what you can, things your prepare for yourself. Eating out can be an issue, try looking up food values for the place you are using, most have online information these days, may be use their approximation for the meal you will be having and then work backwards from there going lighter for breakfast and lunch or snacks how ever your work your days.

Why are you only eating 1200 calories when active?<br>
<br>
That's still dangerously low.<br>
<br>
And ideal weight goes mostly by height, which you didn't mention. If eating too low of calories, weight's not the main concern.<br>
<br>
I'm a recovered anorexic. I'm 5'8"" and had heart failure at 25 years old weighing 134. No precursors or warnings, just started gaining weight, gained 102 lbs pretty much over night in water weight, because the heart had slowed. (Less than two months, felt like it was over night)<br>
<br>
I suggest check with a doctor about your calorie intake, activity level, and your weight gain.<br>
<br>
And do any dieting under a doctor's supervision.<br>

Hard to give much advice without more information (M/F, height, age, overall activity level, etc).<br>
<br>
I'm a 5' 7"" F and once I'm into the 140's it gets harder for me to lose. My hunger tends to escalate quickly (especially if I'm working out) but the scale verifies that I cannot eat more than I am - I do, however, eat a fair bit more than you (with exercise included, sedentary desk job, I get about 1800kcal/day).<br>
<br>
I find it much more manageable to keep my losses slower, anything over 1 pound a week I simply cannot sustain. My weight also tends to ""woosh"" - I won't see much movement on the scale for a couple/few weeks, then ""woosh"" down 1-2 pounds. Rinse and repeat.<br>
<br>
Ideal for me is around 128-132 (ish, I will reevaluate when I get into the 130's). It's not easy. I'm in a healthy weight range, but for my body, it is not healthy (I carry my weight right around my middle, lose from the outside in with the saddle bags the last thing to go). It needs to be a slow process, and it needs to be something you realize is going to be on-going, probably forever. The maintenance forum is great for understanding that we don't get to a ""goal"" and then we're done, but that we need to be doing things that we will sustain indefinitely. </div>"

Before I was anorexic, I was around 125 pounds. I am comfortable at my weight. I have tracked inches. I have recomped to an extent. My waist is 26in. But my hips won’t budge from 38. I know it’s low for most people. But I’m literally pretty full on that. I don’t calculate any veggies or fruit in other than potatoes because it’s just easier to just let those be. I weigh everything. Just frustrated that my body refuses to change even when I really really try. </div>"

5’4”. I had my hormones checked 2 years ago after I had my son. They were fine. It took me over a year to get to prepregnancy weight of 140ish. I just can’t get under that. Most of the extra weight is in my hips and thighs. </div>"

No!!! 1200 is standard for a very short (under 5') female who's bedridden to lose weight. NOT standard for a 5'4"" ACTIVE female.<br>
<br>
Denial is a major part of several psychological disorders.<br>
<br>
I, too, was extremely underweight through teen years. Doctors were always telling me I needed to put on weight (along with family and friends).<br>
<br>
As a young adult, I kept my weight between 130-140 for 7 years. Got pregnant, weight went up to 145, miscarriaged, tried to lose weight from pregnancy, was down to 134 lbs size 9/10.<br>
<br>
Sounds like a healthy weight and size, right?<br>
<br>
I was never hungry, didn't feel like I was starving....Because as someone who'd suffered with an eating disorder... It damaged normal signals... Like hunger, and hormones, metabolism, adrenal issues...<br>
<br>
Now, after 20 years of continuously developing a healthy relationship with food.<br>
<br>
I eat around 1500-1650 to lose, try to NEVER dip below 1300.<br>
<br>
If I exercise, it's 30-45 minutes of light exercising, 3-4 days a week.<br>
<br>
My goal weight, at 5'8"", I try to get to, then maintain is now 165-175...I Know I look fit and healthy here and feel fit.<br>
<br>
When my heart failed, I went to the doctor after putting on just a few lbs while still exercising and dieting... Was told, I was finally just putting on weight, nothing to worry about.... Going back into doctors at 236 lbs a month and a half later, hearing the words ""morbidly obese"" and ""congestive heart failure"" was crushing!!<br>
<br>
I wish someone would have told me this was even a possibility, didn't have internet back then, anorexia was rarely diagnosed back then. It's not worth the risk to drop another inch or two or another 5-10 lbs.<br>
<br>
If your heart fails, and you gain 75-200 lbs of water weight, with stretched deformed loose skin hanging everywhere (arms, thighs, stomach, breast), you'll wish you could have a waist that measures 38"".... much less, hips.<br>
<br>

I'm 5'4 and barely lightly active. I started at 145 lbs and never ate below 1500 cals to get down to 125, but it did take a lot of time.<br>
<br>
If you had a miscarriage just 3 weeks ago, your body is still recovering, which will include water weight fluctuations. You need to give your mind and body a second to heal. Eat maintenance for at least a couple of weeks. Then set yourself to lose 0.5lbs per week and lightly active and eat all those calories. Considering your history, I would think that losing slowly is best. If you feel that you have lasting physical effects from the time you were underweight, you should discuss that with your doctor.<br>
<br>
Do check out the Recomp thread linked in Sugar's post, even if you want to continue losing weight, it gives a great perspective on strength training and body aesthetics.<br>
