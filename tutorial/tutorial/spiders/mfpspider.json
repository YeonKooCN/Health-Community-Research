In order to get a more accurate picture of where you are it might be a plan to start tracking them for a while and see where your intake actually is. If you\u2019re aiming at 1200 but not tracking fruit and veg it\u2019s possible you\u2019re eating closer to the 1500 mark anyway.<br>\n<br>\nHow much difference this might make depends on how much fruit, which fruit, how many vegetables and what veg you\u2019re eating, obviously. Fruit, in particular, can be more calorific than your instinct might tell you.<br>\n<br>\nIn light of your history I\u2019m not going to comment on the level you need to be eating at, others have already done so, anyway. I\u2019m just wondering if getting more accurate numbers to work on you can find your way through your situation. </div>", "<div class=\"Message\">\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteAuthor\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/en/profile/usercard/1007471201\">Coffee_addict22</a> wrote: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/en/discussion/comment/44052680#Comment_44052680\" class=\"QuoteLink\">\u00bb</a></div>\n<div class=\"QuoteText\">\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteAuthor\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/en/profile/usercard/1008721552\">Hannahwalksfar</a> wrote: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/en/discussion/comment/44049195#Comment_44049195\" class=\"QuoteLink\">\u00bb</a></div>\n<div class=\"QuoteText\">Firstly, are you weighing your food?

The only thing I don\u2019t weigh is fruits and veggies other than potatoes. I do a lot of walking and running but it\u2019s hot where I live still. I\u2019m not sure.

Your perception of your body is going to be different right now, because it's been going through changes related to pregnancy. It will take time for your body to shift back to some state of \"normal\". As a recovering anorexic, your idea of normal may not be the actual norm for a person of your height/weight/age.<br>\n<br>\nYou mention that you want hips smaller than 39\", and that once they were 34\". You also mention you've had a son. A hip measurement of 34\" may not be physically possible for you any more. It's quite common for the pelvic area to expand during pregnancy - you're growing a human being after all - and the inner frame doesn't always contract back to where it was. It doesn't mean you're fat or you gained too much weight. Your actual frame may have changed. You can't control that, so you have to learn to change your perception of yourself and set realistic expectations of what you can do.<br>\n<br>\nSending you virtual hugs.

I came across some interesting listening from a UK programme. There was nothing you could have done differently to have prevented it. I hope you feel well enough to invite the little one again one day. Dieting too hard when you are recovering is not going to help, it will probably hinder your recuperation. I agree with those who say to return to maintenance for a while, I'm sure your family will support you. They want you well and achieving in other ways for now.<br>\n<br>\nI wonder if you had started gaining because of your intended second pregnancy and the weight was a natural consequence of having started a little person, I know even at three months a little one in itself weighs little but the surrounding changes do carry weight implications more for some than others. So yes, you were/are a little heavier now, possibly until your hormones, which can take a year to settled back, naturally resolves from this very, very sad situation.<br>\n<br>\nThe one thing which sticks in my mind when I had my daughter so many years ago, was My hips were never the same again, I'd become a woman not the young girl I'd been. Its a very sad fact that, a first pregnancy changes the way our body was called on to work and hip widening can be a consequence of carrying.<br>\n<br>\nPlease take extra special care of yourself.
